## What is Disguise?
**Disguise** is a project that lets you disguise yourself as a player using your head.
It's a reproduction of the KamoofSMP twist.

## How does it work?
### Add the `disguise` command
Can be used by server operators only. It takes a single argument, a player to disguise as.

### Adds the `undisguise` command
Can be used by anyone and allows you to return to normal.

### Adds an `onInteract` event.
This event is triggered by a right-click on a player's head and is linked to the `disguise` command.

## Compatibility
**Disguise** should work anywhere as long as Minecraft is in premium mode.
